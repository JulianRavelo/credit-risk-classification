# Credit risk classification - Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

This repository contains historical data of a lending servoces company. Using this data, the credit_risk_classification.ipynb notebook, has an analysis that intents to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.  

The dataset has 77,537 rows of information, including: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, total debt, loan status, among others.  
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.

The method used was logistic regression and the results are detailed below.  

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
