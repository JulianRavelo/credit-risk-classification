# Credit risk classification - Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

This repository contains historical data of a lending services company. Using this data, the credit_risk_classification.ipynb notebook has an analysis that intends to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.  
The dataset has 77,537 rows of information, including loan size, interest rate, borrower income, total debt, and loan status, among others.  
Using the "loan status" column and a logistic regression model, we split the data into training and test datasets. Using the Sklearn library for Python, we were able to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate the model performance generating a confusion matrix and printing the classification report.  

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
